# A list of regex for allowed warnings to ignore during testing of "aesara-base".
# (More warnings are acceptable here since libraries will be missing.)

--disable-werror
cblas.h: No such file or directory
Using NumPy C-API based implementation for BLAS functions
g\+\+ not detected

# These warnings arise on Windows, and don't seem to be confirmed yet as okay:
g\+\+ not available
don't know how to compile Fortran code on platform 'nt'

# These appear in Linux:

No such file or directory: 'cc'
No such file or directory: 'gcc'

# The following is the first part of a multiline warning which appears since v2.9.2:
#   /opt/conda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/numpy/distutils/system_info.py:2159: UserWarning: 
#       Optimized (vendor) Blas libraries are not found.
#       Falls back to netlib Blas library which has worse performance.
#       A better performance should be easily gained by switching
#       Blas library.
#
# The below regex could potentially match other distinct multiline errors with an equivalent
# leading line, but doing this more robustly would involve refactoring `check-for-warnings.py`.
# I'm not going to bother with that now because this test has not proven useful after the
# initial period when the aesara-base / aesara distinction was implemented and debugged.
/site-packages/numpy/distutils/system_info\.py:(\d+): UserWarning:(\s*)$
